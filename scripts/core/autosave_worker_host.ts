/**
 * Main-thread host for the autosave compression worker (plan §5.4). Lazily
 * spawns the module worker (browser + Electron renderer), forwards raw mesh
 * payloads as transferables, and resolves with the compressed `SCULPT00` blobs.
 * If a worker can't be spawned (no `Worker`, headless context, build missing) it
 * transparently falls back to inline main-thread compression, so autosave always
 * works — only the off-thread speedup is lost.
