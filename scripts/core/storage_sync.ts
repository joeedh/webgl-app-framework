/**
 * Cross-instance settings/flag sync (NW.js multi-instance).
 *
 * Several NW.js windows in one worktree share `.sculptcore` (settings.json,
 * feature-flags.json). Writes go through the app_storage CAS path so they don't
 * clobber each other; this module makes the *readers* converge: it polls each
 * shared file's change token (mtime:size) and, when another instance wrote,
 * reloads that state into the running app.
 *
 * Kept import-free of settings/feature-flag to avoid an import cycle: those
 * modules register a target and stamp their own writes via noteLocalWrite so a
 * poll never reloads an instance's own just-written file (which could stomp an
 * in-memory edit made between the write and the next tick).
