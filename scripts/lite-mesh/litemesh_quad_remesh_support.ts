 * Integration-test support for the host-side quad-remesh path
 * (`sculptcore/documentation/plans/quad-remeshing.md`, M6h). Exposes
 * `globalThis.__quadRemeshTest()`, which the Electron headless harness drives
 * from `--eval` (see `tests/integration/litemesh_quad_remesh.test.ts`).
 *
 * It runs the *real* `litemesh.quad_remesh` ToolOp through the toolstack on the
 * scene's active `LiteMesh`, then exercises undo + redo — capturing a tiny
 * backend-agnostic topology signature (`{ngon, leaf}`) at each stage so the test
 * can assert, on BOTH backends: the remesh changed the mesh (success), undo
 * restored it exactly, and redo reapplied it. The subsequent `--dump` snapshots
 * the redone (remeshed) GPU buffers, so the parity test also gets native↔WASM
 * geometry byte-equality of the remesh *output* for free. Strict all-quad
 * topology is gated upstream in the C++ synthetic suite (`test_remesh_extract`),
 * not re-proven here. Never throws — failures land in the result, since the
 * harness eval seam must stay alive.
 *
 * Lives in the lite-mesh layer (it drives a `LiteMesh` ToolOp) and is pulled in
 * as a side-effect import from `litemesh_test_scene.ts`.
