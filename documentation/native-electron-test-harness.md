# NW.js test harness & CLI (orchestration for the native-addon plan)

Supporting infrastructure for
[`native-electron.md`](native-electron.md): a command-line system for the
NW.js shell that boots the **real** app, builds deterministic test scenes
(notably sculptcore-backed `LiteMesh` scenes), and saves / dumps / screenshots
them headlessly — so the native N-API backend and the WASM backend can be
driven through identical scenarios and diffed for parity.

## Why a procedural scene builder (not a saved `.wproj`)

`LiteMesh` serialization is not wired up yet — its `nstructjs` STRUCT is empty
and `loadSTRUCT`/`dataLink` are stubs (`scripts/lite-mesh/litemesh.ts`). So a
LiteMesh scene cannot round-trip through a `.wproj` today. Instead the harness
builds scenes **procedurally at startup**. The `LiteMesh` constructor builds a
deterministic sculptcore cube (`Mesh_createCube(120,1,1)`), so the same builder
produces byte-identical geometry under either backend — which is exactly what a
parity test needs. When LiteMesh serialization lands, `--save` will also produce
loadable project files; until then `--save` captures everything *except* the
LiteMesh geometry.

## Argument flow

NW.js merges the Node + browser contexts into one window, so there is no main
process and no IPC: the app args reach the renderer **directly** as
`nw.App.argv` — no base64 token, no `additionalArguments` re-injection. The
launcher just spawns `nw <repo-root> <args…>`.

`scripts/core/app_argv.ts` reads `nw.App.argv` in the renderer. The browser
build (no `nw`) sees an empty arg list, so nothing here affects it.

`nwjs/launch.mjs` translates two ergonomic flags before spawning (the rest pass
through untouched to the renderer harness):

- `--remote-debug[=PORT]` → the Chromium `--remote-debugging-port` +
  `--remote-allow-origins=*` switches (a bare `--remote-debug` auto-picks a free
  port when an `--instance` is set, else `9222`).
- `--headless` → the app-only `--apptest-headless` (because `--headless` is a
  real Chromium switch NW.js would intercept). The `nwjs/window.html` bootstrap
  keeps the window hidden under `--apptest-headless` (the manifest starts it
  `show:false`) and opens DevTools unless `--no-devtools`.
- `--instance[=NAME]` / `--ephemeral` → run a second window in the SAME worktree
  concurrently by giving it its own Chromium profile subdir (the default profile
  is per-worktree; see [Multiple instances & per-worktree
  profile](#multiple-instances--per-worktree-profile) below). NAME is a
  persistent profile; bare/ephemeral is a throwaway.

## Flags

### Launcher flags (translated in `nwjs/launch.mjs`)

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--remote-debug[=PORT]` | Enable the Chrome DevTools Protocol endpoint (default `9222`) + `--remote-allow-origins=*`. Drive it with the direct-CDP client `nwjs/cdp.mjs` (no MCP server). |
| `--headless` | Start the window hidden (`--apptest-headless`; CI / batch generation). |
| `--no-devtools` | Don't auto-open DevTools. |
| `--instance[=NAME]` | Run concurrently in one worktree via a per-instance Chromium profile subdir. NAME = persistent (`inst-NAME`); bare = throwaway (`inst-auto-*`, GC'd after a week). Auto-picks a free CDP port with `--remote-debug`. |
| `--ephemeral` | Alias for a bare `--instance` (throwaway profile). |

### Renderer test-harness flags (parsed in `scripts/core/test_harness.ts`)

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--gen-scene <name>` | Build a registered test scene, replacing the default startup file via the **non-cached** path (`genDefaultFile(appstate, 1)` — skips the localStorage startup snapshot). |
| `--scene-arg k=v` | (repeatable) Parameters passed to the builder. |
| `--eval "<js>"` | (repeatable) Eval a JS expression in global scope (where `CTX`/`_appstate` live) after the scene is built and before `--run` tools; failures flag `__apptestResult`. |
| `--run "tool.path(...)"` | (repeatable) Run a `ToolOp` by data-API path. |
| `--save <out.wproj>` | Write a project file after building. |
| `--dump <out.json>` | Write a structured, backend-comparable scene snapshot. |
| `--screenshot <out.png>` | Capture the `#webgl` canvas (best-effort; prefer the CDP screenshot tool). |
| `--backend native\|wasm` | Select the sculptcore backend (`globalThis.__SCULPTCORE_BACKEND`). `native` loads the N-API addon and falls back to `wasm` if the `.node` is absent. |
| `--list-scenes` | Print registered scene names. |
| `--exit` | Quit the app once the scenario completes (via `nw.App.quit()`). |

A normal launch (`pnpm run nwjs`) sets none of these and is unaffected.

## Scene-builder registry

`scripts/core/test_scenes.ts` holds a name→builder map, mirroring
`core/default_file.ts`'s single-builder hook. Builders register **downward**
into this core registry from whatever layer owns their dependencies, because
core must not import lite-mesh / sculptcore:

- `empty`, `default` — registered in `test_scenes.ts` (core-only deps).
- `litemesh-cube` — registered from
  `scripts/lite-mesh/litemesh_test_scene.ts` (pulled in as a side-effect import
  from `scripts/entry_point.js`). Args: `subdiv=<n>`, `light=0`.

To add a scene: `registerTestScene('my-scene', (ctx, lib, scene, args) => {…})`
from the appropriate layer.

## Examples

```bash
# Launch the NW.js shell with harness flags (pnpm run nwjs = node nwjs/launch.mjs):

# Build a LiteMesh cube, dump a snapshot, quit (CI-friendly):
node nwjs/launch.mjs --gen-scene litemesh-cube --dump out.json --exit

# Higher-res cube, no light, save a project file:
node nwjs/launch.mjs --gen-scene litemesh-cube --scene-arg subdiv=240 --scene-arg light=0 --save cube.wproj --exit

# Native backend, headless, scripted parity dump:
node nwjs/launch.mjs --backend native --headless --gen-scene litemesh-cube --dump out.json --exit

# Interactive + scriptable over CDP (drive with nwjs/cdp.mjs):
node nwjs/launch.mjs --gen-scene litemesh-cube --remote-debug
```

Because NW.js merges the Node and browser contexts, the renderer's
`console.log` / native `printf` reach the launching terminal's stdout/stderr
normally — none of the Electron-era fd-redirection workarounds are needed.

The harness publishes its outcome on `window.__apptestResult`, so an external
driver (`node nwjs/cdp.mjs eval "return window.__apptestResult"`) can read
structured results.

## Multiple instances & per-worktree profile

The Chromium `--user-data-dir` holds **only** Chromium internals (single-instance
lock, GPU cache, Crashpad) — **no** app state (that lives in `<cwd>/.sculptcore`).
NW.js keys its default `--user-data-dir` on the manifest `name`, which is
identical in every git worktree, so two worktrees could not run NW.js at once and
their crash dumps collided. `nwjs/launch.mjs` instead derives the profile
**per-worktree** via `nwjs/profile_dir.mjs`:
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\webgl-app-framework\worktrees\<dir>-<hash8>\`, where `hash8` is
over the case-folded worktree root — so each checkout runs independently and
never clobbers another's window, lock, or dumps. Within one worktree:

- `pnpm run nwjs` → the shared `default/` profile subdir.
- `--instance=NAME` → `inst-NAME/` (persistent, named) — the way to run 2+
  windows in one worktree at once (`--instance=a`, `--instance=b`).
- bare `--instance` / `--ephemeral` → `inst-auto-<time36>/`, GC'd after a week.
- The launcher **prints** the chosen profile + Crashpad reports dir on startup.
- Pass your own `--user-data-dir=…` to opt out of all of this.

### Concurrency-safe `.sculptcore` storage

The shared per-worktree `.sculptcore` (`settings.json`, `feature-flags.json`,
`startup.bin`, `autosave/`) is written so instances can share it safely:

- `scripts/core/app_storage.ts` writes **atomically** (tmp + rename, with a
  Windows EPERM retry) and exposes an **optimistic-CAS** `updateText` (read →
  merge → commit-if-unchanged, retry on conflict) plus a `version` change token.
- Settings/flags merge **field-level** through CAS: feature flags by per-key mtime
  (`feature-flag.ts`), settings by baseline-diff (`settings.ts` `mergeSettings`,
  overriding only fields this instance changed; `addonSettings` per id). The
  startup file needs no merge — atomic last-snapshot-wins is correct.
- `scripts/core/storage_sync.ts` polls each shared file's `version` (~1s) and
  reloads settings/flags when another instance wrote (`startStorageSync`, booted
  from `appstate.ts`; a no-op in the browser). Consumers `noteLocalWrite` so a
  poll never reloads an instance's own write. Live addon enable/disable is **not**
  propagated (too risky); the enabled *flags* still converge in the file.
- Autosave (`autosave_backend.ts`) namespaces slot files + a recovery pointer per
  **session** id (`<pid>-<time>-<rand>`), so instances never overwrite each
  other's backups. `readLatest` scans all per-session pointers for the newest (no
  single `latest.json` to race); a launch-time GC prunes dead sessions' backups
  (pid-liveness + a `MAX_DEAD_SESSIONS` cap, keeping the newest crash recoverable).

## Connecting to the live NW.js renderer over CDP

NW.js is Chromium, so `--remote-debug` exposes a standard CDP endpoint
(`GET http://127.0.0.1:9222/json/version` returns the build and a `page` target
for `window.html`). Drive it with the dependency-free **`nwjs/cdp.mjs`** client
(Node 22+, global `fetch` + `WebSocket`):

```bash
node nwjs/cdp.mjs list                                  # CDP targets
node nwjs/cdp.mjs eval "return _appstate.ctx.scene.objects.length"
node nwjs/cdp.mjs eval "return globalThis.__nativeManager.addon.version()"
node nwjs/cdp.mjs shot out.png                          # screenshot the page
```

It fetches `/json/list`, opens the page's `webSocketDebuggerUrl`, and issues
`Runtime.evaluate` in the renderer realm (where `CTX` / `_appstate` /
`__nativeManager` live).

**Why not a chrome-devtools MCP server:** an MCP server binds its browser
connection once, at Claude-Code startup, so it can only attach to a browser
already running on the port at that moment. Any NW.js launched as a child of the
agent dies when the agent exits, so it can never be up *before* the next
Claude-Code start — the ordering can't be satisfied. `nwjs/cdp.mjs` connects on
demand, in-session, to whatever is live on the port, with no restart dance.
