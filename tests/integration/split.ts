/**
 * Backend-pass selection for the split integration run.
 *
 * `tests/integration` runs its suites as TWO jest invocations (see
 * `run-split.mjs`): a WASM pass and a native-N-API pass, selected by the
 * `SC_TEST_BACKEND` env var. Each NW.js launch is a whole Chromium + engine
 * boot, so running both backends inside one invocation doubles the peak
 * process/disk load and makes a native-addon rebuild invalidate the wasm
 * results too.
 *
 * Every suite therefore declares which pass owns it:
 *
 * - per-backend suites (the common case) call `selectedBackends()` and run
 *   their single leg in each pass;
 * - suites that *compare* the backends need both legs live in one process, so
 *   `crossBackends()` / `isCrossBackendPass()` give them entirely to the native
 *   pass (or to the wasm pass when there is no addon to compare against);
 * - backend-agnostic suites call `isDefaultBackendPass()` and run once, in the
 *   wasm pass (an NW.js boot with no `--backend` flag is the wasm app).
 *
 * With `SC_TEST_BACKEND` unset (a plain `jest` invocation) every helper reports
 * "run everything", so a direct jest run behaves exactly as it did before.
