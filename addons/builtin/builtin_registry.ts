/**
 * The single in-bundle builtin registry.
 *
 * Statically imports every builtin that ships inside the main bundle (these are
 * the duplication-unavoidable subsystems — see
 * documentation/plans/native-electron.md / the unified-registrator plan) and
 * registers each as an addon *source* via `addonManager.registerBuiltin`. This
 * does NOT enable them — they flow through the same `start()` → topo-sort →
 * enable lifecycle as third-party addons. The only difference from an external
 * addon is that the module is already imported (no separate compile / dynamic
 * import).
 *
 * Replaces the per-addon `addon_register.ts` side-effect imports that used to
 * live in `scripts/entry_point.js` plus the in-bundle toolmode registration in
 * `scripts/editors/view3d/tools/addon_register.ts`.
 *
 * `manifest.json` stays the single metadata source — imported here directly.
