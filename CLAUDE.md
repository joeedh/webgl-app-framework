## Addons

The builtin editing features (mesh, mesh_edit, curve, subsurf, tetmesh,
pbvh_sculpt, sculptcore) live under `addons/builtin/<id>/src/`. See
[documentation/addons.md](documentation/addons.md) for the full authoring
guide. Key conventions:

- Addons import framework primitives through `@framework/api` (resolves to
  `scripts/framework_api.ts`). **Do not** write
  `../../../../scripts/foo.js` from inside an addon — if a symbol is
  missing from the re-export hub, add it there.
- Peer-addon imports go through `@addon/<id>/api` (the `api.ts` shim file
  in that addon's `src/`). The esbuild plugin
  `tools/addon_api_plugin.js` rewrites these into runtime registry
  lookups.
- Class registration is dispatched through `api.register(cls)` /
  `api.registerAll(...classes)` inside each addon's `register(api)`
  lifecycle hook. The dispatcher handles `ToolOp` / `ToolMode` /
  `DataBlock` / `CustomDataElem` / `SceneObjectData` / `Editor` /
  `nstructjs` registration in one call.
- **Do not** write module-scope `ToolOp.register(...)` /
  `ToolMode.register(...)` / `DataBlock.register(...)` /
  `CustomDataElem.register(...)` / `SceneObjectData.register(...)` /
  `nstructjs.register(...)` side effects in addon code. They bypass the
  per-addon registry and can't be cleanly unregistered. The lone
  exception is `nstructjs.inlineRegister(this, structSrc)` written as a
  static-field initializer, which must stay at class scope.
- The mesh addon collects its 100+ registerable classes into the
  auto-generated `addons/builtin/mesh/src/register_classes.ts`. If you
  add a new class that needs registering, either add it manually to that
  list or rerun `node tools/migrate-mesh-registers.js` to regenerate it.

## Typecheck

Run `npx tsgo --noEmit`, **not** `tsc`. The current main-tsconfig
baseline is 58 pre-existing errors concentrated in
`scripts/editors/view3d/tools/pbvh_sculptops.ts`,
`scripts/sculptcore_demo.ts`, and the sculptcore wasm bindings.

## Cross-layer follow-ups

`TODO.md` (repo root) tracks non-addon consumers of addon files and
cross-addon `scripts/...` path imports that survive the addon-API
migration. Add to it when you discover another one.
