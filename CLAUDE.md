# Agent instructions

## Package manager

- Use pnpm

## Plans

- Write all plans to the `documentation/plans` folder (with proper descriptive names; add
  the current date and time to the name).

## Research

- Write all research surveys / write-ups to the `documentation/research` folder (with
  proper descriptive names). Plans still go in the `documentation/plans` folder.

## Setup commands

- Install deps: `pnpm i`
- Install language server: `pnpm install -g @vtsls/language-server typescript && pnpm install -g typescript-language-server && claude -p "/plugin install typescript-lsp@claude-plugins-official"`
- Build: `pnpm build`
- Release build (no source maps; what the Pages CI ships): `pnpm build:release`
  plus `node sculptcore/make.mjs build wasm --release` —
  see [documentation/releaseBuild.md](documentation/releaseBuild.md)
- Typecheck: `pnpm typecheck`
- Start web server: `pnpm serv`

## Generating type annotations

When generating type annotations:

- Do not add annotations if type can be inferred, e.g.
  - Assignment to known typed variables
  - Assignment to new operator
- Do not use the any type
- Do not use single-line control blocks, e.g. `if (test) action()` is bad,
  `if (test) { action() }` is good.
- Do not do dynamic imports, e.g.
  `InputSet extends import('../../path.ux/scripts/pathux.js').PropertySlots = {}` —
  add a proper type import instead.

## Typecheck

Run `npx tsgo --noEmit`, **not** `tsc`. `pnpm typecheck` wraps this and runs
`pnpm gen:paths` first (see [Data API paths](#data-api-paths)).

## Code style

- Read contents of `documentation/codeStyle.md`
- We have a polyfilter for `Set.filter` and `Set.map`.  These are okay to use.
- Do not transform the `Set.filter` to a spread-to-array-then-filter pattern,
  e.g. do not turn `set.filter(n => n.test(0))` into `[...set].filter(n => n.test(0))`
  Also do not transform into a `Array.from` pattern either.
- Typescript strict mode
- Single quotes, no semicolons
- Use `git mv` when renaming files, such as
  changing JS files to TS ones.

## Testing instructions

- Run tests with `pnpm test`
- Run specific test with `pnpm test [test name]`
- Update snapshots with `pnpm test -u`
- Run eslint with `pnpm eslint --fix [path]` it will
  lint code and fix some problems

## PR instructions

- Title format: `[<project_name>] <Title>`
- Always run `pnpm test` before committing

## Code Comments

Note: roughly preserve comments written by the user however if they ask you to audit
      or correct comments in a file you may edit the comment to ensure correctness.

- **Doc vs non-doc comments**: a *doc comment* documents the signature it sits
  directly above (a function, method, struct, class, or file) — typically `/** */`
  / `///` / a file-level header. Everything else is a *non-doc comment*: inline or
  block comments inside a function body explaining a specific statement or step.
  The 3-line length limit below applies **only to non-doc comments**.
- **Permanent non-doc comments**: keep short and concise — no more than 3 lines.
  A comment longer than 3 lines is allowed at most once per ~500 lines of a file.
  Permanent comments should not reference the prior state of the code.
- **TODO comments**: may exceed the 3-line limit. Mark especially high-priority
  items with `XXX:`; mark ordinary ones with `TODO:`.
- **Refactor / implementation / temp comments**: no length limit, but prefix them
  with `CLAUDENOTE:` so they can be found and stripped later. The final step of
  any plan is to remove the `CLAUDENOTE:` comments — replacing the ones still
  worth keeping with permanent (≤ 3-line) non-doc comments.
- **Doc comments**: not subject to the 3-line limit, but still keep them short
  and concise; only add them for non-obvious function signatures. A doc comment
  may simply explain how a non-obvious parameter behaves when that is shorter
  than describing the whole function.
- **Approved long non-doc comments**: when a non-doc comment genuinely needs to
  exceed 3 lines (or push a file past its budget), you may ask me to approve it.
  If I approve, add an entry in the form `{path}:{function}:{one-line summary}`
  to the nearest sub-project's approved-comments registry — for sculptcore that
  is `sculptcore/approvedLongComments.md` (see `sculptcore/CLAUDE.md` for the
  C++ style requirement). Entries listed there are exempt from the length limit
  and the per-file budget — do not flag or shorten them in a later comment audit.

## Addons

The builtin editing features (mesh, mesh_edit, curve, subsurf, tetmesh,
pbvh_sculpt, sculptcore) live under `addons/builtin/<id>/src/`. See
[documentation/addons.md](documentation/addons.md) for the full authoring guide
(esbuild plugin mechanics, internal vs external ship modes, the mesh
`register_classes.ts` regen). These import/registration rules are always in force:

- Import framework primitives through `@framework/api` (resolves to
  `scripts/framework_api.ts`) — never `../../../../scripts/foo.js`; if a symbol
  is missing from the hub, add it there.
- Import a peer addon through `@addon/<id>/api` (its `src/api.ts` shim).
- Register classes via `api.register(cls)` / `api.registerAll(...)` inside the
  addon's `register(api)` hook — one call dispatches ToolOp / ToolMode /
  DataBlock / CustomDataElem / SceneObjectData / Editor / nstructjs.
- **No** module-scope `*.register(...)` side effects (they bypass the per-addon
  registry and can't be cleanly unregistered). Sole exception:
  `nstructjs.inlineRegister(this, structSrc)` as a static-field initializer.

## Rendering

The realtime renderer is WebGPU-only. See
[documentation/rendering.md](documentation/rendering.md) for the frame topology
(`NormalPass → AOPass → BasePass → AccumPass ⇄ PassThruPass → SharpenPass.{x,y}
→ OutputPass`), bind-group conventions, how to add post-process / scene-walk
passes, and the attribute-driven WGSL material contract
([documentation/shader-attributes.md](documentation/shader-attributes.md); C++
side in [sculptcore/documentation/spatial.md](sculptcore/documentation/spatial.md)).

## Picking

Viewport picking (click-select, brush/circle/box select, transform snap) is
geometric and addon-owned — no GPU id-buffer. Each object type overrides
`castViewRay` / `findNearest` / `castScreenCircle` / `castScreenRect` on its
`SceneObjectData` subclass; core's `findnearest.ts` is a thin dispatcher that
gates on `selectMask`. See [documentation/picking.md](documentation/picking.md).

## Box modeling

A Blender-style polygon-modeling toolmode for `LiteMesh` objects (selection,
extrude, inset, bevel, split-off, subdivide, loop-cut) alongside sculpt mode.
See [documentation/boxModelingMode.md](documentation/boxModelingMode.md) (design
doc: [documentation/plans/boxModelingTools.md](documentation/plans/boxModelingTools.md)).

## Feature-edge marking (seams & sharp)

Interactive knife-style tools (`litemesh.mark_seam_interactive` /
`mark_sharp_interactive`, hotkeys `K` / `Shift+K`) that flag the source-of-truth
`boundary::EDGE_SEAM` / `EDGE_SHARP` attributes, plus a persistent feature
overlay. See [documentation/feature-marking.md](documentation/feature-marking.md).
How those flags are summarized per-vertex and consumed by the boundary-aware
smooth brushes and dyntopo remesher is the boundary-constraint system:
[sculptcore/documentation/boundaryConstraints.md](sculptcore/documentation/boundaryConstraints.md).

## Node editor

The node-graph editor lives in `scripts/editors/node/`: an abstract CSS-transform
pan/zoom editor (`NodeEditorBase`) whose only registered subclass is
`MaterialEditor` (the Shader Editor), editing a `Graph` by data-API path with all
edits going through the undoable `node.*` ToolOps. See
[documentation/node-editor.md](documentation/node-editor.md).

## Icons

UI icons come from a single hand-authored sheet, `assets/iconsheet.svg` — a
16-column grid of 32×32 cells indexed by the `Icons` map in
`scripts/editors/icon_enum.js` (the `iconsheet*.png` files are generated and
unused). See [documentation/iconsheet-guide.md](documentation/iconsheet-guide.md).

## NW.js test harness / CLI

The desktop shell is **NW.js** (the `nwjs/` workspace; `electron/` was removed).
NW.js merges the Node + browser contexts into one window, so there is **no main
process** — `require`, `process`, `nw.Menu`, `nw.Window`, and file dialogs are
all reachable directly in the renderer. Launch with `pnpm run nwjs`. The **NW.js
app root is the repo root** (its `package.json` is the manifest), because NW.js
serves the app dir as the `chrome-extension://` root and cannot reach files
outside it — so `build/`, `scripts/`, and `assets/` must live under it. Drive a
live app over CDP with the dependency-free `node nwjs/cdp.mjs`
(`list` / `eval "<js>"` / `shot <out.png>`) — use direct CDP, not an MCP server.

The shell also takes CLI flags to boot the real app and build/save/dump/screenshot
deterministic test scenes headlessly (`--gen-scene`, `--eval`, `--run`, `--dump`,
`--backend native|wasm`, `--headless`, `--remote-debug`, `--instance`, …), and
runs multiple instances per-worktree with concurrency-safe `.sculptcore` storage.
See [documentation/native-electron-test-harness.md](documentation/native-electron-test-harness.md)
for the full flag reference and the multi-instance / storage model.

## Debug context API (`CTX.debug`)

`ViewContext.debug` (`scripts/core/context.ts`, class `DebugEditorAPI`) is a
small reflection / test-automation surface on the app context, reachable from any
renderer-JS eval context as `CTX.debug` (`CTX` = `_appstate.ctx`) or as
`ctx.debug` in app code — `listEditorTypes()` / `getIconKey()` / `showEditor(...)`.
For the full window-globals / `CTX` / `CTX.api` / `window.DEBUG` map and how to
drive it over CDP or the headless `--eval` flag (including the active-editor
auto-fill that node-graph ToolOps depend on), see
[documentation/debugSurface.md](documentation/debugSurface.md).

## Native sculptcore backend (N-API)

sculptcore runs from the TS app through two interchangeable backends behind one
`IWasmInterface` (`sculptcore/typescript/api/wasm.ts`): **WASM** (browser) and
**native N-API** (NW.js; C++ reflection runtime in `sculptcore/source/napi/`).
The native path is opt-in (`--backend native`), pointers never cross to JS as
numbers, and there are no zero-copy bulk reads. Build with
`node sculptcore/make.mjs build node [--smoke]`. **Adding a new N-API method is a
4-place change** (`napi_runtime.{h,cc}` → `NativeAddon` type → `NativeManager`
method → `makeNativeInterface`). See
[documentation/native-napi-electron.md](documentation/native-napi-electron.md)
(model + backend seam), [documentation/plans/native-electron.md](documentation/plans/native-electron.md)
(status), and [documentation/debugStrokeGuide.md](documentation/debugStrokeGuide.md)
(writing headless stroke tests).

## Crash reporting (Crashpad)

Native sculptcore (`.node`) C++ crashes are captured as Crashpad minidumps and
symbolicated offline (function + `napi_runtime.cc:line`) via the toolkit
`sculptcore/crash/dump.mjs`. Crashpad is on by default in NW.js; dumps land under
the per-worktree `--user-data-dir` the launcher prints on startup (export
`SC_CRASHDUMP_DIR=<that path>` for the toolkit). Self-test flag is
`--apptest-crash` (not `--crash-test`). See
[documentation/plans/crashpad.md](documentation/plans/crashpad.md).

## Dynamic topology

Geometry under a sculpt dab is subdivided/collapsed on the fly to track a target
edge length, attributes interpolated onto new geometry (sculptcore, CPU-only —
GPU offload is optional). See
[sculptcore/documentation/dynamic-topology.md](sculptcore/documentation/dynamic-topology.md)
and [sculptcore/documentation/plans/dyntopo-m7-cascade.md](sculptcore/documentation/plans/dyntopo-m7-cascade.md).

## GPU brushes

When dyntopo is off, the kelvinlet (and, behind soak flag `sculptcore.gpu_brush_grab`,
grab) sculpt brushes dispatch their sbrush WGSL kernels on the renderer's WebGPU
device and scatter deformed positions straight into the node VBOs; the CPU mesh
syncs once at stroke end. Gated on flag `sculptcore.gpu_brush` (default on;
shadow-verify via `sculptcore.gpu_brush_verify`). See
[documentation/gpuBrushes.md](documentation/gpuBrushes.md) (user/dev guide,
troubleshooting, `window.DEBUG.gpuBrush`) and the design plan
[documentation/plans/gpuGlobalBrushes.md](documentation/plans/gpuGlobalBrushes.md).

## Sculpt layers

Re-weightable displacement layers on a LiteMesh (flag `sculptcore.sculpt_layers`,
default off), V2 model: a layer is made the *edit target* (panel toggle →
`litemesh.sculpt_layer_set_target`; weight pinned to 1) and every brush /
dyntopo / GPU stroke then edits it by construction — the delta is derived and
folded on demand (no Layer Draw brush anymore). On a multires level mesh a
layer is a grids-store channel. Weight/enabled/frozen through the undoable
`litemesh.sculpt_layer_*` ToolOps. See
[documentation/sculptLayers.md](documentation/sculptLayers.md).

## Multires subsurf

Multiresolution CC-subdivision sculpting on a LiteMesh (flag `sculptcore.multires`,
default off): the engine owns the grids store + level materialization; the app
attaches one level at a time via undoable `litemesh.multires_*` ToolOps. Adds
Displaced Preview (GPU-amplified finest-level draw) and VDM sculpting (flag
`sculptcore.vdm_sculpt`, default off; Ptex vector-displacement store, undoable
`litemesh.vdm_*` lifecycle + bake ops). Stack and store persist through .wproj.
See [documentation/multires.md](documentation/multires.md).

## Data API paths

See [documentation/datapath-bindings.md](documentation/datapath-bindings.md) for
the binding-system overview (how each class's `static defineAPI` declares props,
how enum/flag icons attach via `.icons(...)`, and how `getDataAPI()` is built).

Valid `path` strings for `container.prop("...")` (and `slider`, `check`, etc.)
are catalogued by walking `getDataAPI()`. After editing `api_define.ts` (or any
class's `defineAPI`), run `pnpm gen:paths` to regenerate
`scripts/data_api/generated/` — `API_PATHS.md` is the human/LLM path reference,
`api-paths.json` the machine-readable catalog, and `datapaths.ts` the committed
`KnownDataPath` autocomplete augmentation. `pnpm typecheck` runs `gen:paths`
first (`pnpm build` does not).

## Feature flags

Runtime boolean knobs for opt-in / experimental features, persisted in
`localStorage` and wired into the Data API. See
[documentation/featureFlags.md](documentation/featureFlags.md) for usage,
how to add a flag, and persistence semantics.

## Cross-layer follow-ups

`TODO.md` (repo root) tracks non-addon consumers of addon files and
cross-addon `scripts/...` path imports that survive the addon-API
migration. Add to it when you discover another one.

## Submodules

- Keep submodules checked out at the HEADs of their current branches, pulling and
  merging as needed — **except** `sculptcore/extern/imgui`, which stays pinned at
  its recorded commit (third-party, version-locked). (`sculptcore/emsdk` is no
  longer a submodule — it is git-cloned and pinned by `make.mjs install-emsdk`
  and is gitignored.)
- The `master` branch must always link submodules at their default-branch commits
  (never pin `master`'s gitlinks to a submodule feature branch).
- **Commit a parent repo and its submodules together** whenever their branch names
  match, or both are on their default branches: make the submodule commit, then
  bump the parent's gitlink, as one logical change. The pinned exception
  (`sculptcore/extern/imgui`) is excluded — bump it deliberately, never as part
  of a co-commit.
- **Parent on a branch, submodule on its default branch:** do not silently commit
  or advance the submodule's shared default branch. Ask the user whether they want
  to commit and/or push the submodule's default branch (and bump the gitlink)
  before doing so.
- **Worktree teardown:** before removing a worktree, every submodule sitting on its
  default branch — except the pinned `sculptcore/extern/imgui` — must be committed
  and pushed, so no work is lost when the checkout goes away.

## Secondary-agent worktree

A persistent git worktree for secondary/parallel agentic work lives at
`C:/dev/webgl-app-framework-agent` (a sibling of this repo; it is not nested
inside it). Use it to run a second agent without disturbing the primary
checkout. Conventions:

- **Idle state = detached at `master`.** `master` is checked out in the main
  worktree, and git forbids the same branch in two worktrees, so the agent
  worktree cannot hold a normal `master` checkout. When not in use it sits in
  **detached HEAD at `master`'s commit**; its submodules sit at their pinned
  (recorded) commits. Leave it this way when you finish.
- **When starting work, switch to a new branch** in the worktree:
  `git -C C:/dev/webgl-app-framework-agent switch -c <branch>`.
- **Only commit submodules you actually modified onto a new branch** — leave
  untouched submodules detached at their pinned commits. Inside a modified
  submodule: `git switch -c <branch>` before committing there, then bump the
  gitlink in the superproject branch.
- **When done, return to idle:** commit/stash or discard your work, then
  `git -C C:/dev/webgl-app-framework-agent checkout --detach master` and
  re-sync submodules (`git submodule update --init --recursive`).
  (`checkout master` will fail — it's held by the main worktree; always use
  `--detach master`.)
- **Submodules populate only from their remotes** (no cross-worktree local-fetch
  of unpushed pinned commits — that recovery path was removed). So
  `git submodule update --init --recursive` requires every pinned submodule
  commit to be reachable from its remote; it fails on local-only commits with
  `Fetched in submodule path '<X>', but it did not contain <sha>`. Two fixes,
  mirroring `new-worktree.mjs`'s `--submodules` modes:
  - **require-pushed** — push the missing submodule commit(s) to their remote
    (`git -C <main-or-other-worktree>/<sub> push origin <branch>`), then re-run
    the recursive update so the worktree matches the recorded pins exactly.
  - **remote-master** — ignore the pins and branch each submodule from its remote
    master tip: `git submodule update --init --recursive --remote`, then
    `git submodule foreach --recursive 'git switch -c <branch>'`. Use this when
    submodule work is local-only/unpushed or you want to start from the latest
    remote.
